Inside Mr. Beans folder:
- "GPS/GPS.ino" to simulate acquisition of GPS data from an end node (e.g. harvester machine), to be then sent to the blockchain (not implemented yet)
- "MetaCoin" folder: storing all custom solidity code under:
	"contracts/harvest.sol"; "contracts/warehouse.sol"; "contracts/trader.sol"; "contracts/sharedlibs.sol".
- "test.js" file: containing instructions to be executed in Truffle console to test written smart contracts. Further instructions are given inside.

******* Supply-chain smart contract architecture *******
We have 3 end IoT nodes which are developed by Peterson and deployed inside respectively harvester's trucks, warehouses, and traders. The first node is responsible for recording all data about soybeans when they are loaded onto the truck. For instance recorded GPS on field serves to testify the origin of the harvest. In addition a flow sensor embedded inside the harvester pipe will save the harvested amount on the blockchain. This is done through function calls to HarvestContract. Once truck is loaded it is directed towards a warehouse. We assume no tampering can be made to the carried product during the trip, under the form of exchanges, which could be enforced by additional sensors on the truck. We anyways prevent addition of content to the truck by storing what he has loaded on the field and comparing it at the warehouse entry point. Warehouse nodes verify the identity of incoming trucks. Only registered and identified trucks can deliver soybean in the warehouse without raising a violation. We assume no other entry point to the warehouse exists, thus no contaminated (untracked) soybean can enter the production line. Here the soybean is processed and packed in bags which are equipped with a unique RFID. All stamped RFIDs are registered on the blockchain to keep track of all existing valid soybean packs. These then exit the warehouse and are shipped to the trader on a truck. At the exit bags loaded on trucks are also registered with their RFID and are checked against the stamped RFIDs. When they arrive at the trader the trucks are identified and their content is verified against what was registered to be loaded at warehouse exit. If any mismatches or unidentified bags are present, a contamination has been present. All contaminations are signaled by specific events sent from the blockchain.
